What does it do?
================

Similar to Google Maps, embedding YouTube videos in your own website is not entirely unproblematic. This is because embedding establishes various connections to Google servers, through which several cookies are stored in the user's browser and information about them is sent to YouTube and Google's DoubleClick advertising service.

With this extension you can reload any content element and plugin via Ajax. The JS-Framework jQuery is not needed!
So you can embed e.g. YouTube videos or Google Maps DSGVO compliant and give the user the possibility to load this content.

Other options:
* Text: Any text (hint) can be created here.
* Button: Text for the button
* Extra Class: Any CSS classes can be added here
* Set cookie if approved: A cookie will be set and the video will be loaded immediately on the next visit.
* Thumbnail: A thumbnail as background image
* Auto size for consent area or background-image - e.g.: 16:9 (responsive)
* Min. height of the consent area or background-image
